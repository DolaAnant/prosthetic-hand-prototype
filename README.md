# 3D Printed Prosthetic Hand with PID Control

## Project Overview
Designed a functional prosthetic hand modelling jointed finger segments. The goal was to improve grip reliability using mechatronic control.

## Key Accomplishments
* **Mechanical:** Improved finger joint movement, reducing friction by 30% by adjusting CAD tolerances to 0.3mm.
* **Controls:** Enabled variable-strength grasping with a response time under 200ms by integrating servo motors and custom PID logic.

## Tech Stack
* **Design:** Onshape (CAD), Bambu Studio (Slicing)
* **Electronics:** Arduino Uno, Servo Motors, Potentiometers
* **Language:** C++
